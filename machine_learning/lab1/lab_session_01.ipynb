    "\n",
    "This lab session assumes you are familiar with the Python programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 1st year courses used scripting/packaging tools (*e.g.* Spyder) and relied on relatively \"low-level\" abstractions (lists, numpy arrays, etc.) and manipulation techniques (*e.g.* `for` loops). While the knowledge of these concepts and tools is mandatory for this course and your future use of Python, we will concentrate in this course respectively on Jupyter Notebooks (more on these later) to write code and \"high-level\", \"more Pythonic\" abstractions (e.g. `pandas`, scikit-learn, plotting libraries) as a coding style.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional documentation can be found there:\n",
    "- [Python 3 documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)\n",

    "\n",
    "# Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "The document you are reading is a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook (formerly IPython Notebooks) is a web-based interactive web application for creating documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. While notebooks represent a good way to build a tutorial or a report, you will still need to rely on more common, scripting IDEs like Spyder or PyCharm, when working on a \"project\" (e.g. by organizing functions in modules to industrialize a data science product).\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook consists of a sequence of cells. A cell is a multiline text input field, and **its contents can be executed** by using `Shift+Enter`, or by clicking either the `Play` button on the toolbar, or Cell > Run in the menu bar. The execution behavior of a cell is determined by the cell’s type. There are three types of cells: *code cells*, *markdown cells*, and *raw cells*. Every cell starts off being a code cell, but its type can be changed by using a drop-down on the toolbar (which will be “Code”, initially). **As part of this course, DO NOT change the type of a pre-existing cell, DO NOT duplicate a pre-existing cell**. However, you can create and change the type of any new cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code cells\n",
    "\n",
    "A code cell allows you to edit and write new code, with full syntax highlighting and tab completion. The programming language used here is Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a code cell is executed, code that it contains is sent to the kernel associated with the notebook. The results that are returned from this computation are then displayed in the notebook as the cell’s output. The output is not limited to text, with many other possible forms of output are also possible, including figures and HTML tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips**:\n",
    "- press the `Tab` key to use auto completion in code cells\n",
    "- press `Shift+Tab` to display the documentation of the current object (the one on witch the cursor is)\n",
    "\n",
    "See e.g. [this introduction](https://miykael.github.io/nipype_tutorial/notebooks/introduction_jupyter-notebook.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Markdown cells\n",
    "\n",
    "You can document the computational process in a literate way, alternating descriptive text with code, using rich text. In IPython this is accomplished by marking up text with the Markdown language. The corresponding cells are called Markdown cells. The Markdown language provides a simple way to perform this text markup, that is, to specify which parts of the text should be emphasized (italics), bold, form lists, etc. See [this cheatsheet](https://www.edureka.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Jupyter_Notebook_CheatSheet_Edureka.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown cells will also render $\\LaTeX$ code escaped with \\\\$\\LaTeX\\\\$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about Jupyter Notebooks, read its [official documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#structure-of-a-notebook-document).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Read-only cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Most cells in these assignments have been marked \"read-only\" meaning you will not be able to modify their content, to avoid mistakes and guarantee some reproducibility when grading them. If you need to inspect what is going on inside such a cell, create a new cell and copy over the content that you want to run/inspect.\n",
    "\n",
    "## `NotImplementedError`\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you see a (modifiable) cell with a `raise NotImplementedError` instruction, it means you should implement something! This cell will generally be preceded by a Markdown cell explaining what you need to do. The following cell usually contains visible and/or hidden tests (to test your code). If you see (seemingly) empty cells after a code cell where you implemented something, it usually means there are only hidden tests that are run against your code! \n",
    "\n",
    "## Save your work!\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't forget to regularly save your work! There is some autosaving but hitting `Ctrl+S` will ease your mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Validate button\n",
    "\n",
    "If you correctly followed the [guidelines to setup your Python environment](https://moodle.ip-paris.fr/mod/page/view.php?id=180914), you should see a \"Validate\" button in the tool bar, next to the Save, +, Scissors, ...\n",
    "Hitting this button, it should turn grey and say \"Validating...\" and show some message at some later point, e.g. \"Success! Your notebook\n",
    "passes all the tests!\". Please use and abuse this button before submitting your assignment on Moodle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "What we will practice today:\n",
